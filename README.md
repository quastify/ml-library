# Machine learning (ML) library

We are dedicated to democratizing machine learning for chemical space by fostering interoperability among different architectures. We are taking the initiative to make powerful frameworks like [schnetpack](https://github.com/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack) and [sGDML](http://sgdml.org/) easier to use. By integrating these architectures into our project, we aim to provide researchers and developers with accessible tools to leverage the potential of machine learning in chemistry. Through interoperability, we enable seamless collaboration and exchange of knowledge across different platforms, promoting innovation and accelerating advancements in chemical research. Our commitment to democratizing machine learning in the chemical space drives us to continuously explore and incorporate new architectures, expanding the possibilities for scientists and practitioners to harness the power of artificial intelligence in their work.
